# Circuit Python

For now, just playing with a Trinket M0 borrowed from the Science Museum shop.

[CircuitPython Documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/circuitpython-analog-out-2)

The Trinket can be a bit flaky. Its memory is tiny. For a while, it thought it was corrupted -- kept working, but wouldn't let me read or modify `main.py`. Seems likely that I'll have to wipe it at some point. So probably safer to work on a real machine and just copy stuff over as needed.
